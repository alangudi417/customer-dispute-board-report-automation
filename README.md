# Customer Dispute Board-Report Automation

## 📋 Project Overview
This VBA automation generates customer segment-specific dispute management reports by consolidating dispute data, merging analyst notes, and producing interactive summary reports for operational review.

The macro automatically opens today's UDM_Dispute workbook for a selected customer segment, enriches the data using information from UDM_Notes, and generates Pivot Tables that summarize open disputes by manager, disputed value, and customer account.

In addition, the automation prepares processor-specific worksheets with employee IDs to streamline report distribution and email communication. By eliminating repetitive report preparation, the solution significantly reduces manual effort while ensuring consistent and accurate reporting across customer segments.

## 📂 Data Sources
The automation processes two Excel workbooks:

    UDM_Dispute.xlsm (per region)
    - This the primary dispute database containing customer and invoice information. The most relevant columns are:
        - AOR "Customer Region"
        - Days 
        - Case ID "Dispute Number"
        - External Reference "Purchase Order"
        - Sales Order
        - Case Title "Invoice Number"
        - Inv Date
        - Customer Number
        - Customer Name
        - Cause Desc
        - Disputed Amount
        - Processor Name "Dispute Responsible"

    UDM_Notes.xlsx
    - this secondary database contains additional dispute notes and related info, just the dispute notes are relevant to be matched against the master dataset, using a unique identifier "Dispute Number (Case ID)"

## ⚙️ Automation Workflow
 The VBA automation performs the complete reporting workflow automatically.
1. Load Customer Segment Report
    - The macro opens the latest UDM_Dispute workbook for the selected customer segment.
    - Example input files:
        - UDM_Dispute 07-01-2026_Africa.xlsm
        - UDM_Dispute 07-01-2026_Europe.xlsm
        - UDM_Dispute 07-01-2026_LATAM.xlsm

    - Each workbook contains information such as:
        - Customer Account
        - Customer Segment
        - Region
        - Invoice Number
        - Dispute Number
        - Disputed Amount
        - Invoice Date
        - Dispute Creation Date
        - Purchase Order
        - Sales Order
        - Dispute Owner

2. Merge Dispute Notes
    - The automation opens the UDM_Notes workbook.
    - Using the unique Dispute Number, it matches every dispute with its corresponding analyst notes and appends the information to the dispute report.
    - This ensures managers always review the latest customer comments and dispute updates.

3. Generate Manager Summary
    - Using Pivot Tables, the macro summarizes dispute activity by manager.
    - The report includes:
        - Total open disputes
        - Total disputed amount
        - Manager workload distribution
    - These summaries provide operational leaders with an immediate overview of dispute ownership across the organization.

4. Prepare Processor Report
    - The automation generates a worksheet containing:
        - Processor name
        - Employee ID
    - This worksheet is designed to support downstream email distribution and reporting activities.

5. Generate Account Analysis
    - The macro refreshes an additional Pivot Table that allows users to analyze disputes by:
        - Customer Account
        - Number of Open Disputes
        - Total Disputed Amount per Customer
        - Managers can quickly filter and prioritize high-value or high-volume customer accounts.

## 📈 Business Problem
- The dispute management team works with weekly dispute reports organized by customer segment (for example, Africa, Europe, North America, Latin America, and Asia Pacific).
- Each customer segment has its own dispute workbook containing hundreds or thousands of customer disputes.
- Every reporting cycle, analysts needed to:
    - Open the customer segment dispute workbook
    - Open the UDM_Notes workbook
    - Match dispute records using a unique identifier
    - Merge dispute notes into the report
    - Generate management Pivot Tables
    - Summarize open disputes by manager
    - Calculate disputed values
    - Filter customer accounts based on business criteria
    - Prepare processor information for email distribution
- Performing these tasks manually required considerable time and increased the risk of reporting inconsistencies.

## 📊 Example Reports
The generated workbook includes multiple analytical views:
- Manager Summary Worksheet
    - Displays:
        - Manager Name
        - Number of Open Disputes "Disputes"
        - Total Disputed Value "Disp. Amount"
- Processor Summary Worksheet
    - Displays:
        - Processor Name
        - Employee ID
- Customer Account Summary Worksheet
    - Displays:
        - Customer Name
        - Number of Open Disputes "Disputes"
        - Total Disputed Value "Disp. Amount"

Managers can quickly identify high-risk accounts requiring attention.
